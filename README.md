#### Project Goal

Search for NBA Player and return relevant statistics

#### Basic Project Needs

[*] Accept input from user (Input: Player Name)
- What way should I expect the input? (ex: full name, first only, last only etc.)
[*] Search using input
[*] Display statistics

#### Additional Concerns

[*] How will I search for the user's input?
[*] How quickly can input be returned?
[*] Should I use a Database that updates at arbitrary intervals?
- Benefits:
1) One place to search for players & grab their statistics
2) Can add columns for querying
- Disadvantages:
1) Code a database management system

#### Engineering Goals

[*] Good abstraction choices
[*] Intuitive handling & separation of concerns
